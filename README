Assignment one for Coursera's cloud computing course

Took a while to import this into eclipse. Steps:

You must have gcc 4.7 installed. And since the Xcode uses 4.2 you don't want to overwrite that. Install it via homebrew or mac ports. I used mac ports:

sudo port selfupdate
sudo port install gcc47
(takes > 1 hour to install)
They are installed to /opt/local/bin/gcc++-mp-4.7 and /opt/local/bin/gcc-mp-4.7.

1. Create an eclipse c++ project 
2. Right click src and import, choose General -> File system. Choose the assignment folder. 
3. Right click project -> Properties -> C/C++ build -> Settings, for 
MacOS X C++ Linker, change g++ to /opt/local/bin/g++-mp-4.7
GCC C++ Compiler, change g++ to /opt/local/bin/g++-mp-4.7
GCC C Compiler, change gcc to /opt/local/bin/gcc-mp-4.7
In GCC C++ Compiler -> Miscellaneous, append -std=c++11
In GCC C compiler -> Miscellaneous, append -std=gnu11
5. Clean, build 

The /opt/local/bin/gcc comes from the C version
